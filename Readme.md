# COVID-19 Early Case Trend Analysis & Recovery Insights

This project analyzes early-stage COVID-19 patient-level data to understand
infection patterns, demographic trends, recovery timelines, and regional impact.

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze demographic distribution of COVID-19 cases
- Identify common infection sources
- Study regional case concentration
- Evaluate recovery duration and influencing factors
- Apply a baseline Machine Learning model for recovery prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Recovery time feature engineering
- Correlation analysis
- Linear Regression model with R² evaluation

## 🧠 Key Insights
- COVID-19 cases varied across age groups and regions
- Recovery duration showed weak correlation with demographic factors
- Linear Regression had limited predictive power due to data complexity
